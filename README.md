Kinect SDK 1.8 Speech Recognition in a WinForm App

This project is a Windows Form example of Kinect based Speech Recogintion. The app demonstrates the use of my SpeechManager class which wraps the required basic functionality for performing Speech Recognition. The class can also be added and/or used in a WPF application if you so wish.

Required Components and/or SDK:

Microsoft Kinect SDK 1.8: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindowsdev/Downloads.aspx

Microsoft Speech SDK v11: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27226

Credit & Kudos:

The code is based on that which can be found within the MS Kinect for Windows Developer Toolkit 1.8 which is available at the same location of the SDK.

Notes:

If you are running the example via XML, please ensure that your required grammar file is present at the location detailed within Form1.cs. It should be copied their on run/debug.
